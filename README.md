Count-based distribution of bacterial genus in human gut micobiome community 

Although the comparison based on sequence-similarity clustered operational taxonomic unit(OTUs) 
is more mainstream in gut metagenome study, the de novo computed OTUs makes the comparision 
between studies difficult. Therefore, despite the difficulty in assigning all reads to correct 
species/genus with high accuracy,especially with only V3-V4 region of 16S RNA sequence, it is 
still worthy of  to have a rough understanding of the community as complementary to OTU-based 
analysis.
